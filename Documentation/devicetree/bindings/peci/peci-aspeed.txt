Device tree configuration for PECI buses on the AST24XX and AST25XX SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible        : Should be one of:
			"aspeed,ast2400-peci"
			"aspeed,ast2500-peci"
			"aspeed,ast2600-peci"
- reg               : Should contain PECI controller registers location and
		      length.
- #address-cells    : Should be <1> required to define a client address.
- #size-cells       : Should be <0> required to define a client address.
- interrupts        : Should contain PECI controller interrupt.
- clocks            : Should contain clock source for PECI controller. Should
		      reference the external oscillator clock in the second
		      cell.
- resets            : Should contain phandle to reset controller with the reset
		      number in the second cell.
- clock-frequency   : The bit frequency of PECI negotiation stage in units of Hz.
		      Driver will calculate the best divisor setting of msg-timing and
		      addr-timing to meet the value.
			  200~2000000

Optional properties:
- clock-sel-hclk    : At ast2600, peci can select the bus clock to Ref. clock (default) or HCLK.
      		  This value determine the bus clock mux to hclk.
- rd-sampling-point : Read sampling point selection. The whole period of a bit
		      time will be divided into 16 time frames. This value will
		      determine the time frame in which the controller will
		      sample PECI signal for data read back. Usually in the
		      middle of a bit time is the best.
		      0 ~ 15 (default: 8)
- cmd-timeout-ms    : Command timeout in units of ms.
		      1 ~ 60000 (default: 1000)
- 64byte-mode       : Enable 64 byte mode of peci transfer

Example:
	peci: bus@1e78b000 {
        compatible = "simple-bus";
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <1>;
        ranges = <0x0 0x1e78b000 0x60>;

        peci0: peci-bus@0 {
            compatible = "aspeed,ast2600-peci";
            reg = <0x0 0x100>;
            #address-cells = <1>;
            #size-cells = <0>;
            interrupts = <GIC_SPI 38 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
            clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_GATE_REF0CLK>;
            resets = <&syscon ASPEED_RESET_PECI>;
            clock-frequency = <1000000>;
            rd-sampling-point = <8>;
            cmd-timeout-ms = <1000>;
        };
    };
