PILOT GPIO controller Device Tree Bindings
-------------------------------------------
gpio-controller device node :

                pilot_gpio_ctrl: pilot_gpio@40423000 {
                        compatible = "aspeed,pilot-gpio";
                        reg = <0x40420000 0x1000>;
                        gpio-controller;
                        #gpio-cells = <2>;
                        gpio-ranges = <&pincontroller 0 0 186>;
                        interrupt-controller;
                        #interrupt-cells = <2>;
                        interrupts = <0 8 4>;
                        status = "disabled";

                };

- compatible            :  "aspeed,pilot-gpio"

- #gpio-cells           : Should be two
                          - First cell is the GPIO line number
                          - Second cell is used to specify optional
                            parameters (unused)

-gpio-ranges            : total 186 pins --->  gpio number 0 to 185
- reg                   : Address and length of the register set for the device

- gpio-controller       : Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.

- interrupts            : Interrupt specifier (see interrupt bindings for
                          details)
- interrupt-controller  : Mark the GPIO controller as an interrupt-controller


Bindings for Client driver nodes :
--------------------------------------------
sample DT node for client driver which uses GPIO_29_4:

sample-gpio-pin{
                compatible = "gpio-test-module";
                gpios = <&pilot_gpio_ctrl  140 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
                interrupt-parent = <&pilot_gpio_ctrl>;
                interrupts = <140 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
                debounce-interval = <PILOT_DEBOUNCE_16MS>;
            };

sample DT node for client driver which uses GPIO_23:			
tempsensor-gpio-pin{
                compatible = "temp-sensor";
                gpios = <&pilot_gpio_ctrl  23 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
                interrupt-parent = <&pilot_gpio_ctrl>;
                interrupts = <23 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
                debounce-interval = <PILOT_DEBOUNCE_8MS>;
            };


1) gpios = < phandle_of_gpio-controllernode , gpionumber , flags>

example:
gpios = <&pilot_gpio_ctrl 14  GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;  ----> GPIO_14
gpios = <&pilot_gpio_ctrl 34  GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; -----> GPIO_29_2

gpio-number:
there are 45 ports 
Each gpio port has 8 pins:
gpios in port0 to port3 are designated as  GPIO_0 - GPIO_32 in data sheet.
These are not multiplexed with any other functionality.

gpios in port16 to port29 are designated as (GPIO_16_0,GPIO_16_1,....GPIO_29_4,GPIO_29_5) in datasheet.
These are multiplexed with other pin functionalities.

gpios in port40 to port45 are designated as (GPIO_30_0 ,GPIO_30_1,....GPIO_45_2,GPIO_45_3) in datasheet.
these are multiplexed with other pin functionalities.

(port4 to port15) , (port30 to port39) - are serialGPIO ports and are not supported by  "drivers/gpio/gpio-pilot.c"

gpio numbers  assigned by  the gpio-driver: "drivers/gpio/gpio-pilot.c" to these gpios are as below:
port0 to port3 ==> gpio0 to gpio31
port16 to port29(29_0 to 29_5)==> gpio32 to gpio141
port40 to port45(45_0 to 45_3) ==> gpio142 to gpio185

these numbers can also be looked up at "drivers/pinctrl/pilot/pilot4_pinctrl_drv.c"
pin numbers in pilot4_pinctrl_drv.c are Ensured to be same as gpionumbers of pins.

2) to  specify irq number and Interrupt type in DT node:

	interrupt-parent = <&pilot_gpio_ctrl>;
	interrupts = < 184  IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>; ---> interrupt on GPIO_45_2

	
interrupt number is same as gpio number.
Interrupt types supported :
 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING,
IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING,
IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH,
IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW

3)  debounce-interval = <debounce-period>
example:
		debounce-interval = <PILOT_DEBOUNCE_16MS>;

vaild debounce period can be found in include/dt-bindings/gpio/pilot-gpio.h
