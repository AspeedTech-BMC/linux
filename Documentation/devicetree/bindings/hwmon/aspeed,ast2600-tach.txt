ASPEED AST2600 Fan Tacho controller device driver

The ASPEED Fan Tacho controller can support upto 16 Fan tachometer inputs.

Required properties for tacho node:
- #address-cells : should be 1.

- #size-cells : should be 1.

- reg : address and length of the register set for the device.

- pinctrl-names : a pinctrl state named "default" must be defined.

- pinctrl-0 : phandle referencing pin configuration of the PWM ports.

- compatible : should be "aspeed,ast2600-tach"

- clocks : phandle to clock provider with the clock number in the second cell

- resets : phandle to reset controller with the reset number in the second cell

fan subnode format:
===================
Under fan subnode there can upto 16 child nodes, with each child node
representing a fan.

Required properties for each child node:
- aspeed,fan-tach-ch : should specify the Fan tach input channel.
                integer value in the range 0 through 15, with 0 indicating
		Fan tach channel 0 and 15 indicating Fan tach channel 15.
		Atleast one Fan tach input channel is required.
- aspeed,pulse-pr : define the tachometer pulses per fan revolution as
            	an integer (default is 2 interrupts per revolution).
            	The value must be greater than zero.
- aspeed,min-rpm : define the minimal revolutions per minute of the measure fan
		used to calculate the sample period of tach
- aspeed,tacho-div : define the tachometer clock divider as an integer
		(default is 5). formula of tacho clock = HCLK / (2^tacho-div)^2

	compatible = "simple-mfd", "syscon";
	#address-cells = <1>;

		reg = <0x0 0x100>;
		clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_AHB>;
