Aspeed ADC

This device is a 10-bit converter for 16 voltage channels.  All inputs are
single ended.

After ast2600, This device split into two individual IPs and each contains 8 voltage channels.

Chip level dtsi:
Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "aspeed,ast2400-adc" or "aspeed,ast2500-adc" or "aspeed,ast2600-adc"
- reg: memory window mapping address and length
- clocks: Input clock used to derive the sample clock. Expected to be the
          SoC's APB clock.
- resets: Reset controller phandle
- #io-channel-cells: Must be set to <1> to indicate channels are selected
                     by index.
- trim_locate: (ast2600 only)
	- First cell is the scu register offset
	- Second cell is the bit field offset
	- Third cell is bit mask (length of the trim data)

Example:
adc0: adc@1e6e9000 {
		compatible = "aspeed,ast2600-adc";
		reg = <0x1e6e9000 0x100>;
		clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_APB2>;
		resets = <&syscon ASPEED_RESET_ADC>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 46 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		#io-channel-cells = <1>;
		trim_locate = <0x5D0 0 0xf>;
		status = "disabled"; 
	}; 
adc1: adc@1e6e9100 {
	compatible = "aspeed,ast2600-adc";
	reg = <0x1e6e9100 0x100>;
	clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_APB2>;
	resets = <&syscon ASPEED_RESET_ADC>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 46 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	#io-channel-cells = <1>;
	trim_locate = <0x5D0 4 0xf>;
	status = "disabled";
};
Board level dts:
Required properties:
- ref_voltage: (ast2600 only)
	- Reference voltage in millivolts for the conversions
- battery-sensing: (ast2600 only)
	- Inform the driver that last channel will be used to sensor battery
Example:
&adc0 {
	trim_locate = <0x5D0 0 0xf>;
	ref_voltage = <2500>;
	status = "okay";
	battery-sensing;

	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_adc0_default &pinctrl_adc1_default
		&pinctrl_adc2_default &pinctrl_adc3_default
		&pinctrl_adc4_default &pinctrl_adc5_default
		&pinctrl_adc6_default &pinctrl_adc7_default>;
};

&adc1 {
	trim_locate = <0x5D0 4 0xf>;
	ref_voltage = <1800>;
	status = "okay";

	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_adc8_default &pinctrl_adc9_default
		&pinctrl_adc10_default &pinctrl_adc11_default
		&pinctrl_adc12_default &pinctrl_adc13_default
		&pinctrl_adc14_default &pinctrl_adc15_default>;
