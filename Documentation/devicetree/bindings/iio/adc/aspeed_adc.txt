Aspeed ADC

This device is a 10-bit converter for 16 voltage channels.  All inputs are
single ended.

After ast2600, This device split into two individual IPs and each contains 8 voltage channels.

Chip level dtsi:
Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "aspeed,ast2400-adc" or "aspeed,ast2500-adc" or "aspeed,ast2600-adc"
- reg: memory window mapping address and length
- clocks: Input clock used to derive the sample clock. Expected to be the
          SoC's APB clock.
- resets: Reset controller phandle
- #io-channel-cells: Must be set to <1> to indicate channels are selected
                     by index.

Example:
adc0: adc@1e6e9000 {
		compatible = "aspeed,ast2600-adc0";
		reg = <0x1e6e9000 0x100>;
		clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_APB2>;
		resets = <&syscon ASPEED_RESET_ADC>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 46 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		#io-channel-cells = <1>;
		status = "disabled"; 
	}; 
adc1: adc@1e6e9100 {
	compatible = "aspeed,ast2600-adc1";
	reg = <0x1e6e9100 0x100>;
	clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_APB2>;
	resets = <&syscon ASPEED_RESET_ADC>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 46 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	#io-channel-cells = <1>;
	status = "disabled";
};
Board level dts:
Required properties:
- vref: (ast2600 only)
	- Reference voltage in millivolts for the conversions
- battery-sensing: (ast2600 only)
	- Inform the driver that last channel will be used to sensor battery
- aspeed,trim-data-valid:
	- type: boolean
	- description:
	The ADC reference voltage can be calibrated to obtain the trimming
	data which will be stored in otp. This property informs the driver that
	the data store in the otp is valid.
Example:
&adc0 {
	vref = <2500>;
	status = "okay";
	battery-sensing;

	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_adc0_default &pinctrl_adc1_default
		&pinctrl_adc2_default &pinctrl_adc3_default
		&pinctrl_adc4_default &pinctrl_adc5_default
		&pinctrl_adc6_default &pinctrl_adc7_default>;
};

&adc1 {
	vref = <1800>;
	status = "okay";

	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_adc8_default &pinctrl_adc9_default
		&pinctrl_adc10_default &pinctrl_adc11_default
		&pinctrl_adc12_default &pinctrl_adc13_default
		&pinctrl_adc14_default &pinctrl_adc15_default>;
