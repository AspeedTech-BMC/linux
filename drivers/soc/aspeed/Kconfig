	tristate "Aspeed ast2400/2500 HOST LPC to BMC bridge control"
	---help---
	  Control Aspeed ast2400/2500 HOST LPC to BMC mappings through
	  ioctl()s, the driver also provides a read/write interface to a BMC ram
	  region where the host LPC read/write region can be buffered.

config ASPEED_LPC_SNOOP
	tristate "Aspeed ast2500 HOST LPC snoop support"
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	help
	  Provides a driver to control the LPC snoop interface which
	  allows the BMC to listen on and save the data written by
	  the host to an arbitrary LPC I/O port.

config ASPEED_LPC_PCC
	tristate "Aspeed Post Code Capture support"
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	help
	  Provides a driver to control the LPC PCC interface,
	  allowing the BMC to snoop data bytes written by the
	  the host to an arbitrary LPC I/O port.

config ASPEED_LPC_MBOX
	tristate "Aspeed LPC Mailbox Controller"
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	help
	  Expose teh ASPEED LPC MBOX registers found on Aspeed SoCs
	  to userspace.

config ASPEED_P2A_CTRL
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	tristate "Aspeed ast2400/2500 HOST P2A VGA MMIO to BMC bridge control"
	help
	  Control Aspeed ast2400/2500 HOST P2A VGA MMIO to BMC mappings through
	  ioctl()s, the driver also provides an interface for userspace mappings to
	  a pre-defined region.

config ASPEED_XDMA
	tristate "Aspeed XDMA Engine Driver"
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON && HAS_DMA
	help
	  Enable support for the Aspeed XDMA Engine found on the Aspeed AST2XXX
	  SOCs. The XDMA engine can perform automatic PCI DMA operations
	  between the AST2XXX (acting as a BMC) and a host processor.

config ASPEED_VGA_SHAREDMEM
	tristate "Aspeed VGA Shared memory"
	depends on SOC_ASPEED
	help
	  To access VGA shared memory on Aspeed BMC, enable this option.
	  This driver used by ManagedDataRegionlV2 specification. In the
	  specification, BIOS will transfer whole SMBIOS table to VGA memory,
	  and BMC can get the table from VGA memory through this driver.

config ASPEED_MCTP

	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON && HAS_DMA
	help
	  Enable support for the Aspeed UDMA Engine found on the Aspeed AST2XXX
	  SOCs. The UDMA engine can perform UART DMA operations between the memory
	  buffer and the UART/VUART devices.

config ASPEED_ESPI
	tristate "Aspeed eSPI Engine Driver"
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	help
	  Enable support for the Aspeed eSPI engine. The eSPI engine
	  plays as a slave device in BMC to communicate with the host
	  side master over the eSPI interface. The four eSPI channels,
	  namely peripheral, virtual wire, out-of-band, and flash are
	  supported.

config ASPEED_ESPI_MMBI
	tristate "Aspeed eSPI MMBI Driver"
	depends on ASPEED_ESPI
